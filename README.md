# Word-Guess-Game

This game was very challanging for me, I got through it with the use of javascript. I have a basic hangman game with an its always Sunny theme. 

My first step was to figure out the theme and the layout, I wanted to have multiple divs that could be accessed using JS. 
Once the basic HTML and CSS were done, I started on my psuedocode, which was a lengthy process. I knew that I would have to start by creating variables that held all the data needed. 
The first array contains all the possible word choices, or answers. 
The next step I took was to create an array that had all the images I wanted to use, however I couldnt figure out how to get them to change with the answers.
