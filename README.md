# Word-Guess-Game

This is a basic hangman style word guess game, with an It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia theme. 

This application will populate a random answer from an array, determine how many letters are in the word, minus the spaces, and populates this in the space to guess. It also gives the user an amount of guesses to guess the letters in the answer. 

If the letters guessed match any of the letters in the answer key, it will populate that guessed letter into the answer spot. If the amount of guesses runs out, there is an alert, and then the site refreshes with a new answer to guess with the amount of wins or losses stored on the front end. 

This app makes use of HTMl5, CSS3, and JavaScript, focusing on JS method construction making use of multiple if/ else statements, and for loops to enable the functionality of the site. 

My role was to build the entire app, focusing on learning how to build multiple methods for an application.
